## Object Basics

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist 
of several variables and functions (called properties and methods when used inside objects).

**Example** - An empty object defined inside a variable

```js
const person = {};
```
<br>

An object is is made up of multiple members, each with it's own name and value. Each name/value 
pair are separated by a comma, and the name and value themselves are separated by a colon.

**Example** - JavaScript object syntax structure

```js
const objectName = {
  member1Name: 'memberValue1',
  member2Name: 'memberValue2',
  member3Name: 'memberValue3'
};
```
